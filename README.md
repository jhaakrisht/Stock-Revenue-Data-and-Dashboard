# Stock-Revenue-Data-and-Dashboard
For this project,I assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. I extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data I visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns and trends. The stocks I work with are Tesla and GameStop.

I build a dashboard that provides a view of key performance indicators in a clear way. Analysis of a data set and extracting key performance indicators are practiced.
I use Plotly for data visualization and Skills Network Labs sand Watson Studio for hands-on lab.
